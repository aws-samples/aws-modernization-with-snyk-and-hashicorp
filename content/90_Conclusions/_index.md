## Congratulations
Congratulations on finishing the workshop.  We encourage you to examine other vulnerabilities in this workshop to review their content.

## Conclusions
In this workshop, we walked through a few examples that start with an Infrastructure as Code project.  This neat project illustrates the value of IaC projects as an effective way to define and deploy infrastructure.  We used terraform and Terraform Cloud to deploy these resources.  We also showed you how security issues may arise through default behaviors or not having visibility into the rich feature set of cloud-based resources.  We used Snyk to reveal these issues plus remediation guidance.

## Cleanup
At hosted events, your AWS resources will be deleted when your accounts are terminated after the event.  Your instructors will notify you about the timeline.

If you ran the workshop on your personal account outside of an event setting, you'll have to ensure the removal of your EC2 instance and the EKS cluster if you did the extra credit.
