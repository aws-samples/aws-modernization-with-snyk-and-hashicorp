# Set Up Your Workspace
AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you donâ€™t need to install files or configure your laptop for this workshop.

We will use Amazon Cloud9 to access our AWS accounts via the AWS CLI in this Workshop. There are a few steps to complete to set this up:

1. Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment
1. Create an IAM role for your workspace
1. Attach the IAM role to your workspace
1. Configure workshop specific requirements


### Create a new Cloud9 IDE environment
Within the AWS console, use the region drop list to select us-east-1 (N. Virginia). This will ensure the workshop script provisions the resources in this same region.

Navigate to the Cloud9 console or just search for it under the AWS console services menu.

Click the Create environment button, and use the name use sh-workshop, then click Next step.

Tip: You are free to customize the look and feel of your environment, including the color scheme.

Tip: Cloud9 requires third-party-cookies. You can whitelist the specific domains. You are having issues with this, Ad blockers, javascript disabler, and tracking blockers should be disabled for the cloud9 domain, or connecting to the workspace might be impacted.

### Next Section: Create IAM Role
In the next section, we describe how to create an IAM role for your Cloud9 environment.
