# Workshop Prerequisites
We'll need to setup the following:

- Snyk Account
- Snyk CLI
- HashiCorp Terraform Cloud account
- HashiCorp terraform CLI

## Snyk Account and Snyk CLI
Your Snyk account allows you to scan your code to see results locally or on the Snyk website.  In this workshop we'll use both the CLI and Website.  You have the additional options of running Snyk within popular IDEs or programmatically with API calls, but those are not covered in this workshop.

## Terraform CLI
The command line interface to Terraform is the terraform command, which accepts a variety of subcommands such as terraform init or terraform plan.

We refer to the terraform command line tool as "Terraform CLI" elsewhere in the documentation. This terminology is often used to distinguish it from other components you might use in the Terraform product family, such as Terraform Cloud or the various Terraform providers, which are developed and released separately from Terraform CLI.

## HashiCorp Terraform Cloud

Terraform Cloud is an application that helps teams use Terraform together. It manages Terraform runs in a consistent and reliable environment, and includes easy access to shared state and secret data, access controls for approving changes to infrastructure, a private registry for sharing Terraform modules, detailed policy controls for governing the contents of Terraform configurations, and more.

Terraform Cloud is available as a hosted service at https://app.terraform.io.
