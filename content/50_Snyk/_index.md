# Snyk 

In this module, we get the code and run some CLI operations with Snyk to find misconfigurations in your Infrastructure as Code definitions.

We will perform these operations:

* Clone a respository with misconfigured Infrastructure as Code assets
* Run a Snyk CLI scan and observe results
* Exploit the vulnerability
* Fix issues locally and re-run scans
* Send results to the Snyk Website
