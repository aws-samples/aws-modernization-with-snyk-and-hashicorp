## Run Snyk IaC

At your command prompt, run this command at the base directory of your repository you checked out.

```bash
cd ~/environment/vulnerable-ec2
snyk iac test
```

{{% notice info %}}
In this repository, we include several commented lined identified with the text `WORKSHOP` that you should review and modify.  In most cases, the changes we ask you to do will be to comment/uncomment lines of text, or to modify an existing line.  We will guide you through those steps.
{{% /notice %}}


This process should only take a few seconds, and you will see many lines of output with a summary similar to what is shown below. The net result is no issues detected.  In the example below, our test Snyk Organization is hamed `hashicorp`.  You will see more output than what is shown below.



```bash
snyk iac test

Issues

Low Severity Issues: 5

  [Low] EC2 API termination protection is not enabled
  Info:    To prevent instance from being accidentally terminated using Amazon EC2, you can enable termination protection for the instance. Without this setting enabled the instances can be terminated by accident. This setting should only be used for instances with high availability requirements. Enabling this may prevent IaC workflows from updating the instance, for example terraform will not be able to terminate the instance to update instance type
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/SNYK-CC-AWS-426
  Path:    resource > aws_instance[ec2] > disable_api_termination
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `disable_api_termination` attribute  with value `true`

*****MULTIPLE LINES DELETED*****

Medium Severity Issues: 3

  [Medium] Security Group allows open ingress
  Info:    That inbound traffic is allowed to a resource from any source instead of a restricted range. That potentially everyone can access your resource
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/SNYK-CC-TF-1
  Path:    input > resource > aws_security_group[allow_port_80_from_anywhere] > ingress
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `cidr_block` attribute with a more restrictive IP, for example `192.16.0.0/24`

  [Medium] Security Group allows open ingress
  Info:    That inbound traffic is allowed to a resource from any source instead of a restricted range. That potentially everyone can access your resource
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/SNYK-CC-TF-1
  Path:    input > resource > aws_security_group[allow_ssh_from_anywhere] > ingress
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `cidr_block` attribute with a more restrictive IP, for example `192.16.0.0/24`

  [Medium] Non-Encrypted root block device
  Info:    The root block device for ec2 instance is not encrypted. That should someone gain unauthorized access to the data they would be able to read the contents.
  Rule:    https://snyk.io/security-rules/SNYK-CC-TF-53
  Path:    resource > aws_instance[ec2] > root_block_device > encrypted
  File:    main.tf
  Resolve: Set `root_block_device.encrypted` attribute to `true`

## Review Results - with context

When you examine the entire output, you'll see several pieces of useful information.

* Severity as Low, Medium, High, or Critical.  Here we see the severity of [Medium.]
* Title, Info, Path, File - details for you to locate the issue within your code, plus some context.
* Rule - A link to the publicly available description.
* Resolve - mitigation on how to address the issue
* A summary plus count of files and severities by issues.

In this example, we have several issues that have a severity of Low or Medium, which is good for this workshop.  The focus will be on the three Medium issues.

The first one is about your AWS Security Group allowing open ingress, or being open to the internet.  That is because the CIDR block access is specified as `0.0.0.0/0` for SSH access.  Typically this is not a good practice, so let's review the file entitled `main.tf` to address the issue.  Open the file in your editor and navigate to the section shown below.

```terraform
resource "aws_security_group" "allow_ssh_from_anywhere" {
  name        = "allow_ssh_from_anywhere"
  description = "Allow SSH inbound traffic from anywhere"

  ingress {
    description      = "SSH from anywhere"
    from_port        = 22
    to_port          = 22
    protocol         = "tcp"
    # WORKSHOP: Modify the following line to a CIDR block specific to you, and uncomment the next line with 0.0.0.0
    # This line allows SSH access from any IP address
#    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
    cidr_blocks      = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
```

Let's provision this instance to show how the application is misconfigured to permit access from the internet.

TODO: We need to add the AWS Keys 
*Previously, we configured an AWS KEY.  We'll need those details to ensure the next parts work.
I assume keys are required for terraform.  Also, we have to evaluate how the settings within Cloud9 for *AWS managed temporary credentials* works for us.

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

There are many lines of output, and worth review.  However, we'll focus on the last lines:

```bash
*****MULTIPLE LINES DELETED*****

Apply complete! Resources: 3 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_ip = "3.238.195.45"
```

Given this IP address, you can attempt to access the instance via SSH with a command like this (your IP address will vary):

```bash
ssh  ec2-user@3.238.195.45
```

The results should look like the text below.  Note how we answer "yes" to the prompt, and we are denied access.  We are denied access because we don't have the ssh key to access the instance, so we can't connect.  However, anybody on the internet can access this instance via SSH and that is the crux of our problem.

```bash
marco@potato ~/code/hashicorp/workshop/mam-vulnerable-ec2 (main)
üêß$ ssh  ec2-user@3.238.195.45
The authenticity of host '3.238.195.45 (3.238.195.45)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:hUp1LZEsGqsaUKkDqOjwutzSKJSpWiny1wJFNIhk3E0.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '3.238.195.45' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
ec2-user@3.238.195.45: Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic).
```

Similiarly, run the following curl command to see how anybody can access your hosted application:

```bash
curl http://3.238.195.45
<h1>Hello World from the AWS HashiCorp + Snyk Workshop on ip-172-31-12-224.ec2.internal</h1>
```

In many cases, you may want the world to access your instance via port 80, and in other cases you may want to limit access.  Let's assume you would prefer to limit access for the purposes of this workshop.


In order to address these issues, we'll destroy the instance because we'll be making changes to the instance before we try these operations again.

```bash
terraform destroy
```

## Next: Fixing IaC issues <!-- TODO: MODIFY the body -->
Now that your EC2 instance is destroyed, we can address the issues starting in the next section.
